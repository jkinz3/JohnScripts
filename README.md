# JohnScripts
A collection of Unreal Engine scripts written by John. JohnScripts.

# How to use
1. Create a "Plugins" folder in your project directory. The project must be a c++ project in order to work.
2. Download or clone into afermentioned "Plugins" folder.
3. Regenerate project files and rebuild project.
4. In the editor, you will find the scripts in a "JohnScripts" section in the right click menu.

# Limitations
These are mostly meant to fit my workflow and handle actions I find myself constantly doing. Some are designed to be used with the new modeling tools in Unreal, which generate meshes with only one set of UVs. As such, these scripts makes some assumptions that might not fit what you want. Go ahead and fork/modify as much as you want
